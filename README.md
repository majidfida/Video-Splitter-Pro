# Video Splitter Pro

**Last Updated: 2025-06-03**

Video Splitter Pro is a Gradio-based tool for slicing large videos into uniform clipsâ€”ideal for preparing datasets to train AI video models (e.g., Hunyuan Video, Wan Video). Simply point to an input folder, set split parameters, and click "Process."

## ðŸ†• Updates (2025-06-03)

* **v2.1.0**:

  * Added an optional **FFmpeg Folder** input in the UI to explicitly specify the path to `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.
  * Updated segmenting logic to ensure each clip is exactly the specified duration (e.g., 1.000s), dropping any leftover milliseconds at the end.
  * Enhanced error handling when `ffmpeg` or `ffprobe` are not found; now prompts user to point to the correct FFmpeg folder.
  * Added a **Custom Caption** textbox in the UI; writes a `.txt` file next to each output clip containing the provided caption.
  * Improved mapping to drop unsupported data/timecode streams, preserving only video and optional audio.
  * Supports both copying original streams (no re-encode) and re-encoding with GPU-accelerated NVENC for H.264/H.265 when available.

## Features

* **Exact-length slicing:** Split into custom-length clips (default 3â€¯s, configurable). Now guarantees each output is exactly N.000â€¯s, discarding any trailing fraction.
* **Flexible encoding:** Choose resolution, frame rate (16, 18, 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 60, or custom), and orientation (portrait/landscape).
* **Multiple codecs:** H.264/H.265 (NVENC if CUDA is available), VP9, AV1; CRF or bitrate control.
* **Audio options:** Keep original audio (`-map 0:a? -c:a copy`) or drop audio; handles files with or without audio seamlessly.
* **GPU acceleration:** Toggle CUDA for NVENC encoding when available.
* **Custom captions:** When a caption is entered, a `.txt` file with the same basename is created alongside each clip.
* **Explicit FFmpeg path:** Optional "FFmpeg Folder" field to point to the exact folder containing `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe`.
* **Stop mid-process:** A Stop button halts splitting immediately.
* **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows/Linux/macOS if FFmpeg is installed.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/videosplitter-pro.git
   cd videosplitter-pro
   ```
2. **Install FFmpeg**:

   * **Windows**: Download a static build, unzip to `C:\ffmpeg\bin`, and ensure that folder is on your PATH.
   * **Linux/macOS**: Install via package manager (e.g., `apt install ffmpeg`, `brew install ffmpeg`).
3. **Run the installer script** (`install.bat` on Windows or `install.sh` on Linux/macOS) to create a Python virtual environment, install dependencies, and launch the app.
4. **Launch the application** (if not started by installer):

   ```bash
   python video_splitter.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input Folder:** Directory containing MP4, MOV, AVI, or MKV files.
2. **Output Folder:** Directory where generated clips will be saved.
3. **Clip Duration:** Length (in seconds) of each output clip. Clips will be exactly this duration (e.g., 1.000s).
4. **(Optional) FFmpeg Folder:** If FFmpeg is not on your system PATH or you want to specify a custom location, enter the folder path containing `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`). Otherwise, leave blank.
5. **Custom Caption:** (Optional) Enter any text here. A corresponding `.txt` file will be created next to each generated clip, containing this caption.
6. **Advanced Settings:**

   * **Use Original Settings:** Copies video (and audio) streams without re-encoding; preserves original codec, resolution, and bitrate, but still truncates to exact clip lengths.
   * **Frame Rate:** Choose a preset (16, 18, 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50, 60) or select "custom" to enter your own FPS.
   * **Resolution:** Choose a preset resolution or select "custom" and enter width Ã— height (e.g., `720x1280`).
   * **Video Codec:** H.264, H.265, VP9, or AV1. If CUDA is available and you pick H.264/H.265, NVENC will be used automatically for faster encoding.
   * **Bitrate:** Choose a target bitrate (e.g., `5000k`, `10000k`, `20000k`, `50000k`) when re-encoding.
7. **Process Videos ðŸš€:** Click to start slicing. The status box will display progress or errors.
8. **Stop Button:** Click to halt any ongoing job immediately.

## Changelog

### v2.1.0 (2025-06-03)

* Introduced "FFmpeg Folder" field to explicitly set `ffmpeg.exe` and `ffprobe.exe` paths.
* Switched to per-chunk `ffmpeg -ss â€¦ -t â€¦` calls for exact N.000â€¯s segments, eliminating fractional leftovers.
* Added unified mapping `-map 0:v -map 0:a?` to drop unsupported data streams (timecode), preserving video and optional audio.
* Enhanced error messages when FFmpeg binaries are missing or misconfigured.
* Added "Custom Caption" support; writes `.txt` alongside each segment.

### v2.0.0 (2025-05-15)

* Initial release of Video Splitter Pro.
* Basic GUI with folder selectors, duration, FPS, resolution, codec, and bitrate options.
* GPU-accelerated NVENC support for H.264/H.265 when a CUDA-enabled GPU is detected.
* Ability to copy original streams (`-c copy`) or re-encode.
* Automatic folder creation with timestamped output directory.
